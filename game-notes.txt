# Green Phantom Racer
# A game about racing in the future


# Track consists of several different features (pit entrance, pit exit,starting line,straight,curve,turn)
# Basically a roll and move
# What you roll is based on:
# The feature you are on
# Nearby cars

# Your vehicle has several stats, which are affected by points
# Each car has a number of stats [0-100]
# Chassis - Used to keep the car from wrecking
# Fins - Used to determine saftey on turns and curves
# Thrusters - Used to determine speed
# Sensors - Used to dodge other cars and as a failsafe on turns
# Reactor - Used to deteremine pits
# Fragility Score - 600-total of all others


# Each "turn" during the race
	# Start with the car in first place
	# Determine move by rolling speed (Thrusters-D100)
		# Minimum of 20 speed
			# -1 for every 10
		# Move spaces and accumulate danger and maneuver
		# Straight - Costs 5 Speed
		# Curve - If maneuver fails, costs 10 Speed, if you can't pay, danager!
		# Turn - If maneuver fails, costs 20 Speed, if you can't pay, danager!
		# Pass An Opponent - 1 danger
		# On space as an opponent - 3 danger
	# Maneuver Checks
		# Check with D100 vs Fins
		# If fins is higher, ignore
		# If lower, add a danger
	# Resolve dangers
		# Check with D100 vs Sensors
		# If this fails, check against durability
		# If this fails, take on D100 damage
		# If damage ever exceeds fragility, you'll wreck!
			# Adjacent cars immediatly suffer 10 danger
			# If damage exceeds 50%, put on pit flag so you'll pit 
	# Spend Fuel
		# Fuelcell vs D100
		# If this fails, will put on the pit flag

# Pitstops
	# When a car passes pit lane, they may just enter
		# Repair 2D100 damage
		# Refill
	# Wastes a turn

# Wear and Tear
	# At the end of the race, every point of damage you recieved (total) is converted into part fatigue
	# Randomly distributed amongst parts to increase minimum and decrease maximum that you must put into a part

# Tour
	# 10 Races, each with qualifiers
	# Points
	# Modifying car by more than X amount costs points
